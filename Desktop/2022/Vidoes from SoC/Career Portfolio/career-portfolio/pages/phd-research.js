            <p>
                In September 2019, I started my PhD in Environmental Studies at The University of Salford, where I had previously completed a Masters degree <i>(M.Sc.)</i> in <strong><i>Environment Assessment and Management</i></strong> back in June 2018.

                My PhD research looks at air pollution perceptions and responses from a Nigerian and Uk perspective. I have a keen interest in understanding how people perceive and respond to air pollution as well as the management strategies in place to tackle air pollution issues.
