           <br></br>
           <br></br>
            Other social media platforms might feel heavy with too many options, too many people sharing too much you do not necessarily care about...
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            With Familia, we want to bring the people you care about closer to you!
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            How many times did you have to ask your daughter for the size of shoes of your grandson? Has your son ever asked you about the postal address of his sister? Do you never remember what your husband's blood group is? Ever asked your wife what is the birth date of your father-in-Law?
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Familia will centralise these snippets of information for you and for your close family to know.

           <p>
            The app also offers a secure place where you can exchange messages and pictures with all the family members. No need for various cloud platsform, exchanging pictures over Messenger and having to share that with people outside your family or inner circle.
